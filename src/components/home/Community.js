              Every bootcamp has different needs, but many overlap. Every
              bootcamp teaches important coding languages, but not all of them.
              Harness the Collaborative community of all bootcamps working
              together to build tools that improve quality of education for all.

              Do you need to differentiate from competition with a unique
              functionality reflecting your business model? Or a beautiful
              storefront? Spree empowers you to do both, because itâ€™s a set of
              building blocks which developers can move around at will.

              The Code Learning Project is cloud-ready, so lets you scale up as
              your bootcamp grows. It is also great for online bootcamps or
              academies as they scale internationally.

              An active community of developers keeps this project moving
              forward submitting pull request or issues, but it takes a group of
              focused developers and testers collaborating closely to release
              new versions and resolve any ongoing issues. Our core team has
              your back day-in and day-out!
